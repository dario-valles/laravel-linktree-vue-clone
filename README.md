## Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) on your system, and then clone this repository.

Next, navigate in your terminal to the directory you cloned this, and spin up the containers for the web server by running `docker-compose up -d --build site`.

The following are built for our web server, with their exposed ports detailed:

- **nginx-linktree** - `:8081`
- **mysql-linktree** - `:33061`
- **php-linktree** - `:9001`

Three additional containers are included that handle Composer, NPM, and Artisan commands *without* having to have these platforms installed on your local computer. Use the following command examples from your project root, modifying them to fit your particular use case.

- `docker-compose run --rm composer update`
- `docker-compose run --rm npm run dev`
- `docker-compose run --rm artisan migrate`
